## Revenue Projections (Launch Year)

### Conservative Estimate
```
Assumptions:
- 1,000 total users by Month 3
- 10% conversion to premium
- Average plan: Monthly (K50)

Monthly Revenue:
100 users × K50 = K5,000/month

Year 1 Revenue:
K5,000 × 9 months (after 3-month ramp up) = K45,000
```

### Moderate Estimate
```
Assumptions:
- 3,000 total users by Month 6
- 15% conversion to premium
- Average plan: Quarterly (K120 ÷ 3 = K40/month)

Monthly Revenue:
450 users × K40 = K18,000/month

Year 1 Revenue:
K18,000 × 6 months (after 6-month ramp up) = K108,000
```

### Optimistic Estimate
```
Assumptions:
- 5,000 total users by Month 6
- 20% conversion to premium
- Average plan mix: 40% Quarterly, 30% Yearly, 30% Monthly

Monthly Revenue:
1,000 premium users × K42 avg = K42,000/month

Year 1 Revenue:
K42,000 × 9 months = K378,000
```
